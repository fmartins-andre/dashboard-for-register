# DASHBOARD FOR REGISTER

Get data from Escriba Register database and show it in a web dashboard

## About

This is a really simple and restricted app ( REST API + React Web App ) to get data from Escriba Register database and show it in a nice fashion.

It intends to be used by Escriba Register users only, for now.

## Why?

Escriba Register screens may not be very pleasant sometimes, and also may not show all data you want in a single view, so, this project aims to solve this problem in a specific way.

For now, it'll show a list of analysts and their current working processes, in a way the manager can follow the team production.
